Creating 2D array .. 

Here we can create dynamic array where each position is array itself


i.e ->

cin >> m >> n;

int ** p = new int*[m];
for(int i =0;i<m;i++)
{
    p[i] = new int*[n];
    
    for(int j =0;j<n;j++)
    {  p[i][j];
    
    }
    
    here we are creating array of array first 
    which is of size m;
    
    then we are allocating size of each array which is size n;
    
    then in each array of size n we are putting elements
