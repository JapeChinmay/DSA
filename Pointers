Address typecastingg


Why do we need to give pointers different data type rather than Pointers itself??
--   As pointer will go to the stored address to dereference the value it will need the data type to bring correct value .

e.g   int a  =5
      int *p = &a;
      
      
      p will go to address of a and will look fo 4 bytes as it is given in int;
      *p = 5;
      otherwise it would have  been different .
      
      
      
      /////////// typecassting ////////////
      
      
      Implicit and explicit typecasting.
      
      
      int a   =4;
      char b = a;
      This will do implicit typecassting and cout <<b;
      will print in terms of char;
      but ..
      
      in pointers
      
     int *a = &i;
     char * p = a;
     this won't help,and will give error;
     
     
    -- char *p = (char*)a;
    
    
    we need to do explicit typecasting , to get desired results;
    
    In above examaple , 
    cout << a <<endl;
    will print  address of i but
    cout << p << endl;
    will print the first char of given address and then it will print till it finds null character in the given address;
